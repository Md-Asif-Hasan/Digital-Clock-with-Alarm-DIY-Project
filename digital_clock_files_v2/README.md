## Digital Alarm Clock - Files Package (v2)

Files included:

* digital\_clock\_finished\_schematic\_clean.kicad\_sch  : cleaned schematic scaffold for KiCad (text S-expression).
* README.md                                         : short instructions for opening files.
* schematic\_reference.jpg                            : original circuit diagram for reference (if present).
* original\_zips/                                     : copies of previously generated ZIPs (if available).

If the .kicad\_sch file doesn't open in your KiCad version:

1. Open the .kicad\_sch in a text editor (VS Code/Notepad++) to inspect the content. The file is plain text.
2. In KiCad Schematic Editor: File -> Open -> select the .kicad\_sch file.
3. If KiCad complains, create a new empty schematic in KiCad and paste the contents of the .kicad\_sch into the editor's text view,
   or use the text editor to ensure the file encoding is UTF-8 without BOM and save, then try opening again.
4. Run ERC and replace the placeholder symbols with the official KiCad library symbols as needed.

Contact me here if you still face issues and tell me the error message KiCad shows â€” I'll attempt a format compatible with your KiCad version.
